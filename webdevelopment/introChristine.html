    Hi, my name is Shunan Zheng but my preferred name is Christine. I currently live in New York City. I am a first year graduate student majoring in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri. I work as a high school math teacher at a charter school in Brooklyn, NY. I specialize mostly in teaching different levels of algebra courses. I have a dog named Gohan. I also have two cats named Momo and Luna. I spend a lot of my free time hanging out with my animals. A fun fact about me is that I am a third degree black belt in taekwondo. I was part of the taekwondo team at NYU where I competed in various competitions. I have never coded before but I am very excited to learn in this course since it’s a skill I’ve always wanted to learn. My hope for this course is to learn new transferable skills. I used https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/ to check my writing.
