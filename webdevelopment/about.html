        <h3>Educator Credentials Content Page</h3>
        <p><em>Hi! I’m Christine!</em> I graduated class of 2020 from New York University 
            where I got my Bachelor of Science in math education. After graduation, 
            I got my New York State teaching certification for mathematics 7-12 with 
            grades 5-6 extension. Over the past 3 years, I’ve dedicated myself to 
            teaching algebra at New Visions Charter High School for Advanced Math and 
            Sciences in Brooklyn, NY. <br>I cater to a diverse student population including 
            English language learners and students with learning disabilities. I mainly 
            specialize in teaching algebra 1 and algebra 2 where I’ve successfully led 
            various work such as an SAT program and the regents preparatory program for 
            the algebra 1, geometry, and algebra 2 regents. Whether it is online or in 
            person settings, I’ve fostered inclusive and effective learning environments. 
            I am passionate about teaching math and I strive to make a positive impact 
            on all students.</p>
